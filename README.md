## CALMSEA
We use Expected Improvement to find high desities of Copepod or Chlorophyll. This code was tested in Mausund in June 2024.

### Silcam 
The SilCam is a baklit camera installed in the hull of the AUV. When the AUV moves water flows through the opening and the camera can picture what is inside the volume. The particles are segmented into individual particles and the paricles are classified
using [PySilCam](https://github.com/SINTEF/PySilCam) developed by SINTEF.
